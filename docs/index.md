# Welcome to hook!

hook is a RESTful, extendable Backend as a Service that provides instant backend
to develop sites and apps faster, with dead-simple integration for iOS, Android,
JavaScript and more.

It follows the same principles from [nobackend](http://nobackend.org/), [hoodie.js](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.js) and [Parse](http://parse.com)

**Requirements**: PHP 5.4+, or [PHP 5.3](More/Deployment/#deploying-on-php-53).
